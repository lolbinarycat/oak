# Platformers
Check out how to make a simple 2d platformer. This has been broken into parts leading up to putting it all together.

## start
Learn to set up an oak scene with a single potentially movable character. 
## moving
Get your character to move left and right.
## falling
Implement basic collision and make the character fall if they are not on solid ground.
## jumping
Bind the ability to jump if we are on the ground.
## correct jumping
Update ground detection to only be able to jump on the ground not when falling through ground.
## complete
Put it all together!
